## Customer_behavior_analysis

In this new publication, we will discuss advertising on social networks. For this, I collected data on the Kaggle site to form and save a predictive model for future predictions with new data that my model did not know.



The data contains 5 columns: an identifier for each customer, their age, their estimated salary, and a binary feature regarding the purchase of the product (0 means that the customer did not buy the product and 1 means that they bought the product), this is the target variable.



In this publication, we learn:



1. A brief visualization of the data

2. A brief preprocessing of the data

3. Model creation and evaluation via Scikit Learn and Tensorflow Kerans

4. How to save and upload a template to Scikit Learn with the pickle library

5. How to make a prediction by taking any client into our dataset
